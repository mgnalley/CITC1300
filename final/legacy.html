                <h3>Impactment</h3>
                <p>The band was also known for their close relationship with their audience, maintaining an almost cult-like following throughout
                     their career. Fans appreciated their authenticity, as Rush never conformed to mainstream trends but instead pursued their 
                     artistic vision. This devotion was evident during their farewell tour, "R40," where audiences filled arenas to celebrate

            <h3>The Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
                The origins of Rush trace back to a group of teenage friends with a shared passion for music in the suburbs of Toronto,
                 Canada. In 1968, Alex Lifeson, John Rutsey, and Jeff Jones formed the first iteration of the band, playing local high 
                 school gigs and small venues. However, Jones soon left, and Lifeson invited his childhood friend, Geddy Lee, to take 
                 over bass and vocal duties. The trio started performing under the name Rush, with Rutsey on drums. In these early years, 
                 they primarily played covers of popular rock songs while gradually developing their own sound. In 1974, just before their 
                 debut album release, Rutsey left the band due to health concerns, leading to the recruitment of drummer and lyricist Neil 
                 Peart. Peart's arrival marked a turning point for Rush, as his complex drumming style and intellectual songwriting elevated 
                 the band's music to new heights. With this final lineup solidified, Rush began their journey to becoming one of the most 
                 respected and innovative rock bands of all time.
