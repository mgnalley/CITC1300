    <h2>Sample Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Neil Peart's lyrics are known for their intelligence and depth. Rather than focusing on love or heartbreak, Rush explored themes like philosophy, freedom, science fiction, and individualism.</p>
    <p><strong>Tom Sawyer:</strong> “His mind is not for rent to any god or government.”</p>
    <p><strong>The Trees:</strong> “There is unrest in the forest, there is trouble with the trees...”</p>

    <p>From the hard rock sound of their debut album to the synthesizer-driven experimentation of the 1980s, Rush continuously evolved. <em>Permanent Waves</em> marked a turning point, blending radio-friendly songs with complex musicianship. Later albums like <em>Snakes & Arrows</em> and <em>Clockwork Angels</em> showed the band still pushing creative boundaries well into the 21st century.</p>

<p>Each record feels like a chapter in a novel—cohesive, conceptual, and rich with musical and lyrical themes that resonate across generations. Their work remains essential listening for any serious fan of rock music.</p>
<p>Unlike many rock bands of their era, Rush focused on poetic storytelling and philosophical introspection. Neil Peart, who wrote most of the lyrics, drew from literature, science fiction, and real-world philosophy. His work invites listeners to think deeply about life’s challenges and triumphs.</p>

<p>Songs like “Subdivisions” explore teenage alienation and conformity, while “Freewill” emphasizes personal responsibility and autonomy. Rush's lyrics resonate with fans who value not just rhythm and melody, but meaning.</p>
