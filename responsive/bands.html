            <h3>Ninja Sex Party</h3>
        <p>Although not always as evident, NSP has been heavily influenced by 
            Rush. The band's frontman, Dan Avidan, has been a huge fan of theirs
            for years and is constantly seen making references and wearing Rush shirts. 
            NSP has done quite a few covers of Rush songs, such as Subdivisions and 
            Closer to the Heart. In one of their most recent albums, the Prophecy, 
            the ballad like stories told feels reminiscent to Rush's infamous album 2112.</p>
