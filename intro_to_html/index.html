        <h1>Napoleon Dynamite</h1>
        <p>Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy movie about an awkward teenager who helps his friend run for class president, while dealing with a rather different family back home.</p>
        <p>In a small town in Idaho, Napoleon has a hard time fitting in. He has his pocket tots kicked (no, thats not a euphemism), he's shoved into lockers, and called names. His grandmother gets in a dune buggy accident, and his Uncle Rico comes to take her plac while she's in the hospital, making Napoleon's life even more strenuous. Uncle Rico and Napoleon's brother Kip team up to sell tupperware. Napoleon meets a new student name Pedro, a very quiet and neutral Hispanic kid. They decide to put Pedro in the running for class president against Napoleon's crush and popular mean girl, Summer Wheatley. </p>
