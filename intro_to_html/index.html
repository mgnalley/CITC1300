   <h1>Napoleon Dynamite</h1>
   <p>Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy movie about an awkward teenager who helps his friend run for class president, while dealing with a rather different family back home.</p>
 <p>In a small town in Idaho, Napoleon has a hard time fitting in. He has his pocket tots kicked (no, thats not a euphemism), he's shoved into lockers, and called names. His grandmother gets in a dune buggy accident, and his Uncle Rico comes to take her place while she's in the hospital, making Napoleon's life even more strenuous. Uncle Rico and Napoleon's brother Kip team up to sell tupperware. Napoleon meets a new student name Pedro, a very quiet and neutral Hispanic kid. They decide to put Pedro in the running for class president against popular mean girl, Summer Wheatley, who Pedro wants to ask to the school dance. He is promptly rejected. Napoleon and Pedro meet Deb, another awkward student who makes and sells keychains and other accessories. Pedro wins class president, and goes to the dance with Deb. Napoleon asks another popular girl to the dance, whose mother is guilted into making her go with him by Uncle Rico. In the end, Pedro is class president, Napoleon wins Deb over, and Kip falls in love. This movie is, in my humble opinion, a cinematic masterpiece. </p>
